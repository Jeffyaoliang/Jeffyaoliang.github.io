# About

I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). My research interest includes wireless communication, mobile computing, digital circuit design.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei Gong](https://ubiot.ustc.edu.cn/weigong) of [Ubiquitous Battery-free Internet of Things Laboratory](https://ubiot.ustc.edu.cn/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/), University of Science and Technology of China. I was advised by [Prof. Ameer Abehedahi](https://www.ece.mcmaster.ca/~ameer/) from [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece/), McMaster University.

You can find my CV here: [Yaoliang Bian's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
